ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xxxristen.

I have just completed the Generation SG's full stack developer boot camp, and is looking out for opportunities to apply the knowledge I've gained.

Here's the link to [my portfolio](http://xxxristen-portfolio.vercel.app), consisting of the projects I've done during the boot camp.

My DP may suggest hostility but I'm actually very friendly. ðŸ˜„

While I may not the brightest, I am definitely a hardworking individual who give my best and take pride in the work I deliver.
